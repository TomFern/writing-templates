ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tomas Fernandez. I live in Argentina. Over my professional career, Iâ€™ve worn many hats: sysadmin, dba, and developer. I loved them all.

A few years ago, I needed a change and began freelancing. One thing led to another, and I found a passion for technical writing. After a few years of freelancing, I was fortunate enough to be offered a position as a full-time writer at [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com).

You can find my personal blog at [tomfern.com](https://tomfern.com) and my professional writings at the [Semaphore blog](https://semaphoreci.com/author/tfernandez).
