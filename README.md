# Writing Templates

Here are Markdown blog writing templates that add include support to Markdown. Makefiles are included to build the final document in multiple formats.

## Templates

- `markdown-with-includes`: a hacky method for using includes in plain Markdown. You write in plain Markdown.
- `multimarkdown`: these templates use MultiMarkdown (MMD) which has native includes. You write in MMD and export plain Markdown.
